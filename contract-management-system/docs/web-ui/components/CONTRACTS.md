# Contract Management Component Documentation

## Overview
The Contract Management component provides a comprehensive interface for creating, managing, and tracking contracts between participants in the Digital Contract Management System. It supports different participant roles and their specific contract management needs.

## Component Structure

### Data Models

#### Contract
```rust
pub struct Contract {
    id: String,
    template_id: String,
    status: ContractStatus,
    parties: Vec<Party>,
    terms: ContractTerms,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    metadata: ContractMetadata,
}
```

#### ContractStatus
```rust
pub enum ContractStatus {
    Draft,
    PendingReview,
    UnderReview,
    ApprovedByParties,
    Active,
    Completed,
    Terminated,
    Expired,
}
```

#### Party
```rust
pub struct Party {
    organization_id: String,
    role: PartyRole,
    status: PartyStatus,
    signed_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

## UI Components

### Contract List
```rust
#[component]
pub fn ContractList() -> impl IntoView {
    // List view of contracts with filtering and sorting
}
```

### Contract Details
```rust
#[component]
pub fn ContractDetails(contract_id: String) -> impl IntoView {
    // Detailed view of a single contract
}
```

### Contract Creation Form
```rust
#[component]
pub fn ContractCreationForm() -> impl IntoView {
    // Multi-step contract creation form
}
```

## Workflows

### Contract Creation Flow
1. Select contract template
2. Add participating parties
3. Customize terms
4. Set metadata
5. Save draft or submit for review

### Review Process
1. Initial submission
2. Party notifications
3. Review period
4. Feedback collection
5. Revision cycle
6. Final approval

### Contract Activation
1. All parties approve
2. System validation
3. Contract activation
4. Party notifications
5. Access provisioning

## API Integration

### Endpoints
```rust
// Contract operations
GET    /api/contracts
POST   /api/contracts
GET    /api/contracts/:id
PATCH  /api/contracts/:id
DELETE /api/contracts/:id

// Contract reviews
POST   /api/contracts/:id/reviews
GET    /api/contracts/:id/reviews
PATCH  /api/contracts/:id/reviews/:review_id

// Contract versions
GET    /api/contracts/:id/versions
POST   /api/contracts/:id/versions
```

## Security

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- Action-level authorization
- Data visibility rules
- Audit logging

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Secure transmission
- Version control
- Data integrity checks

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_contract_creation() {
        // Test contract creation flow
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_contract_validation() {
        // Test validation rules
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
async fn test_contract_workflow() {
    // Test complete contract lifecycle
}
```

## Performance
