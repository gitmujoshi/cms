# Contract and Enclave Management Architecture

This document describes the architecture and implementation details of the Contract Management System's contract and enclave components.

## Contract Management System

### Overview
The contract management system provides functionality for creating, managing, and enforcing digital contracts between Training Data Providers and Training Data Consumers. It supports complex contract terms, digital signatures, and lifecycle management.

### Key Components

#### Contract Data Model
- `ContractData`: Core contract structure containing:
  - Basic metadata (id, title, description)
  - Party information (provider_id, consumer_id)
  - Contract status
  - Terms and conditions
  - Digital signatures
  - Timestamps

#### Contract Terms
- `ContractTerms`: Detailed contract specifications including:
  - Data access scope and permissions
  - Usage restrictions
  - Retention periods
  - Security requirements
  - Compliance requirements
  - Optional pricing terms

#### Security Requirements
- Configurable encryption levels (Standard, High, Military)
- Network isolation options
- Audit logging requirements
- Custom security policies

#### Contract Lifecycle States
- Draft
- PendingSignature
- Active
- Suspended
- Terminated
- Expired

### Digital Signatures
- Multiple signature types supported:
  - Digital signatures
  - Biometric signatures
  - Multi-factor authentication signatures
- Signature verification and validation
- Timestamp and audit trail maintenance

### Database Schema
The contract system uses a PostgreSQL database with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE contracts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    provider_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES identities(id),
    consumer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES identities(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    terms JSONB NOT NULL,
    signatures JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
);
```

## Enclave Management System

### Overview
The enclave system provides secure computation environments for training machine learning models using confidential computing technologies, specifically AWS Nitro Enclaves.

### Key Components

#### Enclave Data Model
- `EnclaveData`: Core enclave structure containing:
  - Basic metadata (id, name)
  - Provider information
  - Status
  - Attestation data
  - Configuration
  - Runtime metrics

#### Enclave Configuration
- Resource allocation:
  - CPU cores
  - Memory (MB)
  - Storage (GB)
- Network policies:
  - Ingress/egress rules
  - Encryption requirements
  - TLS version requirements
- Security policies:
  - Secure boot requirements
  - Measured boot
  - Allowed signers
  - Debug mode settings

#### Attestation System
- Remote attestation support
- PCR (Platform Configuration Register) measurements
- Quote generation and verification
- Signature validation
- Verification reporting

#### Enclave Lifecycle States
- Initializing
- Running
- Suspended
- Failed
- Terminated

### Database Schema
The enclave system uses a PostgreSQL database with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE enclaves (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    provider_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES identities(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    attestation JSONB,
    configuration JSONB NOT NULL,
    metrics JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
);
```

## Integration with IAM System

### Identity Management
- Both contracts and enclaves are associated with identities
- Identity verification for contract signing
- Identity-based access control for enclave operations
- Credential rotation and management

### Audit Logging
Comprehensive audit logging for all operations:
- Contract creation, updates, and signing
- Enclave creation and attestation
- Status changes
- Security-relevant events

### Security Considerations
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Network isolation for enclaves
- Regular credential rotation
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Secure boot and attestation verification

## API Endpoints

### Contract Management
- `POST /api/v1/contracts` - Create new contract
- `GET /api/v1/contracts` - List contracts
- `GET /api/v1/contracts/{id}` - Get contract details
- `PUT /api/v1/contracts/{id}` - Update contract
- `DELETE /api/v1/contracts/{id}` - Delete contract
- `POST /api/v1/contracts/{id}/sign` - Sign contract
- `POST /api/v1/contracts/{id}/activate` - Activate contract

### Enclave Management
- Create and manage enclaves
- Monitor enclave status
- Verify attestation
- Configure security policies
- Access runtime metrics

## Performance Considerations

### Contract Operations
- Efficient JSONB storage for flexible terms
- Indexed queries for common operations
- Optimized signature verification

### Enclave Operations
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Efficient attestation verification
- Optimized secure computation

## Future Enhancements
1. Support for contract templates
2. Advanced contract analytics
3. Enhanced attestation mechanisms
4. Multi-enclave orchestration
5. Advanced security policies
