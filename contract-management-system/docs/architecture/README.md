# Architecture Overview

## System Components

The Digital Contract Management System consists of several key components that work together to provide secure contract management and model training capabilities:

### 1. Contract Management System
The contract management system handles the lifecycle of digital contracts between data providers and consumers. See [Contract Management](contracts_and_enclaves.md#contract-management-system) for details.

Key features:
- Contract creation and validation
- Digital signature workflow
- Terms and conditions management
- Contract state tracking
- Audit logging

### 2. Enclave Management System
The enclave system provides secure computation environments using AWS Nitro Enclaves. See [Enclave Management](contracts_and_enclaves.md#enclave-management-system) for details.

Key features:
- Enclave provisioning
- Attestation verification
- Resource management
- Security monitoring
- Network isolation

### 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
The IAM system manages user identities, roles, and access control. See [Identity Management](identity.md) for details.

Key features:
- Identity verification
- Role-based access control
- Credential management
- Policy enforcement
- Audit logging

## Data Flow

1. **Contract Creation**:
   - User authenticates via IAM
   - Creates contract through Web UI
   - Contract Service validates and stores contract
   - Audit events are logged

2. **Model Training**:
   - Contract terms are verified
   - Enclave is provisioned
   - Data is securely transferred
   - Training occurs in isolated environment
   - Results are validated and stored

3. **Access Control**:
   - IAM validates user identity
   - Roles and policies are enforced
   - Actions are logged for audit

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-factor authentication support

2. **Encryption**:
   - TLS for all communications
   - At-rest encryption for data
   - Secure key management

3. **Isolation**:
   - AWS Nitro Enclaves for compute
   - Network security groups
   - Resource isolation

## Performance Considerations

1. **Scalability**:
   - Horizontal scaling of services
   - Database connection pooling
   - Caching where appropriate

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Metrics collection
   - Performance tracking
   - Resource utilization

3. **Optimization**:
   - Query optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Efficient resource usage

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed on AWS with the following components:

1. **Compute**:
   - ECS Fargate for services
   - EC2 for Nitro Enclaves
   - Lambda for event processing

2. **Storage**:
   - RDS for PostgreSQL
   - S3 for object storage
   - ElastiCache for caching

3. **Networking**:
   - VPC with private subnets
   - NAT Gateway
   - Application Load Balancer

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**:
   - Additional compute regions
   - Enhanced caching
   - Load distribution

2. **Security**:
   - Enhanced attestation
   - Additional encryption options
   - Advanced threat detection

3. **Features**:
   - Contract templates
   - Advanced analytics
   - Additional integrations
