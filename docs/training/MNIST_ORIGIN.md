## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Model Architecture**
   ```python
   model = tf.keras.Sequential([
       tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
       tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
   ])
   ```
   - Based on TensorFlow's Keras API
   - Uses a simple feed-forward neural network
   - Includes dropout for regularization

2. **Training Configuration**
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
   - Metrics: Accuracy
   - Default epochs: 10
   - Default batch size: 32

### Model Parameters and Weights

1. **Model Architecture Details**:
   - Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 flattened)
   - Hidden layer: 128 neurons
   - Output layer: 10 neurons (one for each digit)
   - Total parameters: ~101,770 (784 * 128 + 128 * 10 + 128 + 10)

2. **Weight Management**:
   - Model weights are saved to S3 bucket at path: `s3://contract-management-bucket-bkvww1ps/checkpoints`
   - Checkpoints are saved with timestamps in the format: `mnist_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
   - Only the best model weights are saved (based on validation accuracy)
   - Final model is saved with suffix `_final`

3. **Weight Initialization**:
   - Default Keras weight initialization is used
   - Dense layer weights are initialized using Glorot (Xavier) initialization
   - Bias terms are initialized to zeros

4. **Regularization**:
   - Dropout rate: 0.2 (20% of neurons are randomly dropped during training)
   - No explicit L1/L2 regularization is used

5. **Training Progress Metrics**:
   - Initial accuracy: ~9.38%
   - Mid-training accuracy: ~36.06%
   - Final accuracy: ~97.75%
   - Loss progression shows steady decrease from ~0.45 to ~0.07
   - Memory usage: ~188MB for training data

## Usage in Contract Management System
The MNIST implementation serves as a template for document classification in the contract management system, demonstrating:
1. Model training best practices
2. Production deployment patterns
3. Monitoring and logging standards
4. Security implementation guidelines

This implementation provides a solid foundation for building more complex document classification models while maintaining production-grade quality and security standards.

## AWS Nitro Enclaves Integration Plan

### High-Level Plan

1. **ECS Task Definition & Deployment**
   - Switch from standard Fargate to EC2-backed ECS tasks with Nitro Enclave support.
   - Update Terraform and deployment scripts to provision EC2 instances with enclave-enabled AMIs.

2. **Enclave Application Changes**
   - Use AWS KMS and Nitro Enclaves SDK to decrypt data inside the enclave.
   - Update the training code to fetch the encrypted MNIST data from S3, pass it to the enclave, and decrypt/process it there.

3. **S3 Data Handling**
   - Store the MNIST dataset in an S3 bucket encrypted with a KMS key.
   - Update the deployment and training scripts to download the encrypted data and only decrypt it inside the enclave.

4. **IAM & Security**
   - Update IAM roles and policies to allow access to the encrypted S3 bucket and KMS key, but only from the enclave.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Update Infrastructure for Nitro Enclaves

- **ECS Task Definition & Terraform Changes**
  - Update the ECS task definition to use EC2 launch type instead of Fargate.
  - Modify Terraform to provision EC2 instances with enclave-enabled AMIs (e.g., `m6i`, `c6i`, `r6i`).
  - Ensure the ECS task definition includes enclave options and runs on compatible EC2 instances.

#### Step 2: S3 Data Handling

- **Encrypt MNIST Data**
  - Store the MNIST dataset in an S3 bucket encrypted with a KMS key.
  - Ensure the S3 bucket and KMS key are accessible only from the enclave.

#### Step 3: Training Code & Enclave Runtime

- **Data Download & Decryption**
  - Update the training container to download the encrypted MNIST data from S3.
  - Use the Nitro Enclaves SDK and KMS to decrypt the data inside the enclave.
  - Perform model training using the decrypted data.

#### Step 4: Deployment Script

- **Update Deployment Scripts**
  - Modify the deployment scripts to use the new ECS service/task definition.
  - Ensure the enclave is started and used for decryption/training.

#### Step 5: IAM & Security

- **Update IAM Roles & Policies**
  - Ensure IAM roles and policies allow access to the encrypted S3 bucket and KMS key, but only from the enclave.

#### Step 6: Testing & Validation

- **Test the Deployment**
  - Deploy the updated infrastructure and verify that the MNIST data is decrypted only inside the enclave.
  - Validate the training process and ensure security measures are effective.
